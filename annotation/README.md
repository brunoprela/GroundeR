# Query & annotation representation

### Name

Each feature file is named as ```[File ID].pkl``` which corresponds to the file ID in [Flickr30K Entities](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~bplumme2/Flickr30kEntities/).

### Feature organization

Each file is a dictionary containing information for query features and annotations. Each domain's name and content is listed below:<br/>
**```gt_pos_all```**: It is a list of length ```N```. ```N``` represents the number of queries. The ```i```-th element of this list is also a list, recording the ```i```-th query's positive proposals' IDs among the ```100``` proposals generated by [Selective Search](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/isis/publications/bibtexbrowser.php?key=UijlingsIJCV2013&bib=all.bib) or [Edge Box](https://github.com/pdollar/edges). The positive proposals are defined as the proposals with an Intersection of Union (IoU) larger than ```0.5``` for the corresponding ground truth bounding box of the ```i```-th query.<br/>
**```pos_id```**: It is an ```N``` dimensional vector. The ```i```-th element represent the proposal ID which covers most with ground truth bounding box for the ```i```-th query. If the most covered proposal's IoU is less than ```0.5```, we replace the proposal ID as ```-1```.<br/>
**```sens```**: It is a list of length ```N```. The ```i```-th element of this list is also a list, which represents the word ID sequence of the ```i```-th query.<br/>
**```gt_box```**: It is an ```N x 4``` matrix. The ```i```-th row represents the ground truth bounding box annotation for the ```i```-th query. The annotation is in the form of ```[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]```.<br/>
